If this course was a city, it'd be Berlin; seriously cool and full of super friendly people from every kind of background! 

From dental hygienists to artists, handball players to retail assistants, I was relieved to find I wasn't the only complete coding novice when I arrived.

<!-- This course is great if you're a budding entrepreneur with an idea you're looking to turn into reality or just someone with an interest in tech in general. A word of caution though - don't expect to leave with a totally finished product. One thing I learnt was that building an app takes time and dedication, much beyond what you can reasonably achieve as a beginner in five weeks. This course really is just an introduction, but an absolutely fantastic one at that. I can't recommend it highly enough! -->
